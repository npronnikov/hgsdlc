# AIDLC Reverse Engineering

## Goal
Produce a complete, accurate picture of the existing system so that all subsequent
AIDLC stages (requirements, design, code generation) can make informed decisions
without re-reading the whole codebase each time.

---

## Step 1 — Multi-Package Discovery

### 1.1 Scan Workspace
- All packages (not just mentioned ones)
- Package relationships via config files
- Package types: Application, CDK/Infrastructure, Models, Clients, Tests

### 1.2 Understand the Business Context
- The core business that the system is implementing overall
- The business overview of every package
- List of Business Transactions that are implemented in the system

### 1.3 Infrastructure Discovery
- CDK packages (package.json with CDK dependencies)
- Terraform (.tf files)
- CloudFormation (.yaml/.json templates)
- Deployment scripts

### 1.4 Build System Discovery
- Build systems: Brazil, Maven, Gradle, npm
- Config files for build-system declarations
- Build dependencies between packages

### 1.5 Service Architecture Discovery
- Lambda functions (handlers, triggers)
- Container services (Docker/ECS configs)
- API definitions (Smithy models, OpenAPI specs)
- Data stores (DynamoDB, S3, etc.)

### 1.6 Code Quality Analysis
- Programming languages and frameworks
- Test coverage indicators
- Linting configurations
- CI/CD pipelines

## Step 2 — Generate Business Overview

Create `aidlc-docs/inception/reverse-engineering/business-overview.md`:

```markdown
# Business Overview

## Business Context Diagram
[Mermaid diagram showing the Business Context]

## Business Description
- **Business Description**: [Overall business description of what the system does]

- **Business Dictionary**: [Business dictionary terms that the system follows and their meaning]

## Component Level Business Descriptions
### [Package/Component Name]
- **Purpose**: [What it does from the business perspective]
- **Responsibilities**: [Key responsibilities]
```

---

## Step 3 — Generate Architecture Documentation

Create `aidlc-docs/inception/reverse-engineering/architecture.md`:

```markdown
# System Architecture

## System Overview
[High-level description of the system]

## Architecture Diagram
[Mermaid diagram showing all packages, services, data stores, relationships]

## Component Descriptions
### [Package/Component Name]
- **Purpose**: [What it does]
- **Responsibilities**: [Key responsibilities]
- **Dependencies**: [What it depends on]
- **Type**: [Application/Infrastructure/Model/Client/Test]

## Data Flow
[Mermaid sequence diagram of key workflows]

## Integration Points
- **External APIs**: [List with purposes]
- **Databases**: [List with purposes]
- **Third-party Services**: [List with purposes]

## Infrastructure Components
- **CDK Stacks**: [List with purposes]
- **Deployment Model**: [Description]
- **Networking**: [VPC, subnets, security groups]
```

---

## Step 4 — Generate Code Structure Documentation

Create `aidlc-docs/inception/reverse-engineering/code-structure.md`:

```markdown
# Code Structure

## Build System
- **Type**: [Maven/Gradle/npm/Brazil]
- **Configuration**: [Key build files and settings]

## Key Classes/Modules
[Mermaid class diagram or module hierarchy]

### Existing Files Inventory
[List all source files with their purposes — these are candidates for modification in brownfield projects]

**Example format**:
- `[path/to/file]` - [Purpose/responsibility]

## Design Patterns
### [Pattern Name]
- **Location**: [Where used]
- **Purpose**: [Why used]
- **Implementation**: [How implemented]

## Critical Dependencies
### [Dependency Name]
- **Version**: [Version number]
- **Usage**: [How and where used]
- **Purpose**: [Why needed]
```

---

## Step 5 — Generate API Documentation

Create `aidlc-docs/inception/reverse-engineering/api-documentation.md`:

```markdown
# API Documentation

## REST APIs
### [Endpoint Name]
- **Method**: [GET/POST/PUT/DELETE]
- **Path**: [/api/path]
- **Purpose**: [What it does]
- **Request**: [Request format]
- **Response**: [Response format]

## Internal APIs
### [Interface/Class Name]
- **Methods**: [List with signatures]
- **Parameters**: [Parameter descriptions]
- **Return Types**: [Return type descriptions]

## Data Models
### [Model Name]
- **Fields**: [Field descriptions]
- **Relationships**: [Related models]
- **Validation**: [Validation rules]
```

---

## Step 6 — Generate Component Inventory

Create `aidlc-docs/inception/reverse-engineering/component-inventory.md`:

```markdown
# Component Inventory

## Application Packages
- [Package name] - [Purpose]

## Infrastructure Packages
- [Package name] - [CDK/Terraform] - [Purpose]

## Shared Packages
- [Package name] - [Models/Utilities/Clients] - [Purpose]

## Test Packages
- [Package name] - [Integration/Load/Unit] - [Purpose]

## Total Count
- **Total Packages**: [Number]
- **Application**: [Number]
- **Infrastructure**: [Number]
- **Shared**: [Number]
- **Test**: [Number]
```

---

## Step 7 — Generate Technology Stack

Create `aidlc-docs/inception/reverse-engineering/technology-stack.md`:

```markdown
# Technology Stack

## Programming Languages
- [Language] - [Version] - [Usage]

## Frameworks
- [Framework] - [Version] - [Purpose]

## Infrastructure
- [Service] - [Purpose]

## Build Tools
- [Tool] - [Version] - [Purpose]

## Testing Tools
- [Tool] - [Version] - [Purpose]
```

---

## Step 8 — Generate Dependencies

Create `aidlc-docs/inception/reverse-engineering/dependencies.md`:

```markdown
# Dependencies

## Internal Dependencies
[Mermaid diagram showing package dependencies]

### [Package A] depends on [Package B]
- **Type**: [Compile/Runtime/Test]
- **Reason**: [Why dependency exists]

## External Dependencies
### [Dependency Name]
- **Version**: [Version]
- **Purpose**: [Why used]
- **License**: [License type]
```

---

## Step 9 — Generate Code Quality Assessment

Create `aidlc-docs/inception/reverse-engineering/code-quality-assessment.md`:

```markdown
# Code Quality Assessment

## Test Coverage
- **Overall**: [Percentage or Good/Fair/Poor/None]
- **Unit Tests**: [Status]
- **Integration Tests**: [Status]

## Code Quality Indicators
- **Linting**: [Configured/Not configured]
- **Code Style**: [Consistent/Inconsistent]
- **Documentation**: [Good/Fair/Poor]

## Technical Debt
- [Issue description and location]

## Patterns and Anti-patterns
- **Good Patterns**: [List]
- **Anti-patterns**: [List with locations]
```

---

## Constraints

- Analyze the ACTUAL workspace — never fabricate file contents or class names.
- Keep all artifacts in `aidlc-docs/inception/reverse-engineering/`; never write
  application code into `aidlc-docs/`.
- If a component type is absent (e.g., no infrastructure), note "N/A" rather than
  omitting the section.
- Diagrams must use valid Mermaid syntax (test mentally before writing).
